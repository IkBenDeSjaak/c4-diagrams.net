Please also check the **newest version** of my plugin available at https://github.com/hycomsa/hycom-c4

The new version contains slightly smaller elements with larger fonts - seems to be more readable. You also find there additional types of containers - web browser and mobile application. Maybe new version will be more suitable for you.
